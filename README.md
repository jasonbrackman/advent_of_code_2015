Rust practice

* Day_01 - Wrote tests first and had an opportunity to play with chaining iterators.  Sort of like List Comprehensions for Python.
* Day_02 - Had some issues with min/max - Python is a lot easier to pull those items from a list()
* Day_03 - Working with HashMap
* Day_04 - md5 crate used - but of jankiness working with u8.  Lots of ways to optimize this -- but answers were found.
