Rust practice

* Day_01 - Wrote tests first and had an opportunity to play with chaining iterators.  Sort of like List Comprehensions for Python.
* Day_02 - Had some issues with min/max - Python is a lot easier to pull those items from a list()
* Day_03 - Working with HashMap
* Day_04 - md5 crate used - bit of jankiness working with u8.  Should optimize this -- but answers were found.
* Day_05 - String Manipulation / Peeking(), split, take, ... 
* Day_06 - Working with the regex crate and stack issues with vec / also line endings are different on mac/pc
* Day_07 - working with HashMaps - After this assignment I figure it is a type of smart pointer.
